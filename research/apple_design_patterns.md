# Apple Design Patterns Research

## Key iOS Design Principles (from Apple HIG)

### Core Characteristics
1. **Medium-size, high-resolution display** - Design for clarity
2. **One-handed use** - Controls in middle/bottom area for easy reach
3. **Multi-touch gestures** - Swipe to navigate, intuitive interactions
4. **Quick interactions** - People often spend 1-2 minutes checking updates

### Best Practices from Apple HIG
1. **Limit onscreen controls** - Focus on primary tasks and content
2. **Secondary details discoverable with minimal interaction**
3. **Adapt to appearance changes** - Dark Mode, Dynamic Type
4. **Support swipe gestures** - Navigate back, initiate actions in list rows
5. **Controls in middle/bottom** - Easier to reach with one hand
