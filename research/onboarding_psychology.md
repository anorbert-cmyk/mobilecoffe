# Onboarding Psychology Research

## 9 Key Psychological Principles for App Onboarding

### 1. Zeigarnik Effect (Incomplete Tasks)
- People remember incomplete tasks better than completed ones
- Use progress bars, checklists, and missions
- Creates urgency to complete the onboarding
- Example: Ghost's "Getting Started" checklist increased conversions

### 2. Peer Pressure / Social Proof
- People follow their peers' behaviors
- Show how many others use the app
- Referral programs leverage this (Dropbox 3900% growth)
- "Join 10,000+ coffee enthusiasts"

### 3. Success-Oriented Achievement
- Focus on what users will ACHIEVE, not features
- Frame benefits in terms of outcomes
- "Become a home barista" vs "Learn coffee recipes"

### 4. Gamification
- Add rewards, badges, levels
- Progress tracking motivates continued use
- Unlock content as user progresses

### 5. Paradox of Choice (Fewer Choices)
- Too many options = decision paralysis
- Limit choices to 3-4 options max per screen
- Guide users through decisions step by step

### 6. Familiarization / Mere Exposure Effect
- People prefer things they're familiar with
- Use recognizable patterns and UI conventions
- Introduce new concepts gradually

### 7. Feel-Good Experiences
- Positive emotions increase engagement
- Celebrate small wins
- Use encouraging language and visuals

### 8. Social Facilitation
- People perform better when observed
- Community features, sharing progress
- Leaderboards (optional)

### 9. Ambiguity Effect
- People avoid options with unknown outcomes
- Be clear about what each choice leads to
- Show previews of what's next

## Plato's Three Sources of Human Behavior
1. **Desire** - What the user wants to achieve
2. **Emotion** - How they feel about achieving it
3. **Knowledge** - Understanding how to achieve it (the "Aha! Moment")

## Best Practices for Coffee App Onboarding

### Experience Level Selection
- **Beginner**: "I'm new to specialty coffee"
- **Intermediate**: "I make coffee at home sometimes"
- **Advanced**: "I'm a coffee enthusiast"

### For Beginners - Machine Purchase Flow
1. "Do you want to buy equipment?" (Yes/No)
2. Budget selection (visual, not numbers):
   - "Getting Started" ($100-300)
   - "Home Barista" ($300-700)
   - "Serious Setup" ($700-1500)
   - "Prosumer" ($1500+)
3. Purpose/Goal:
   - "Quick morning espresso"
   - "Milk-based drinks (lattes, cappuccinos)"
   - "Pour-over and filter coffee"
   - "Full home café experience"
4. Personalized recommendations

### Progressive Disclosure
- Don't show everything at once
- Reveal features as user progresses
- Keep initial screens simple and focused

### Key Metrics to Track
- Onboarding completion rate
- Time to first coffee made
- Return rate after 7 days
